# first-project-with-python
A simple Ludo board game implemented using Python and pygame. This project recreates the classic multiplayer Ludo game with turn-based mechanics, dice rolls, and player pieces.

** Features**
Classic Ludo game mechanics

Multiplayer support (2-4 players)

Dice rolling animation

Basic piece movement logic

Visual Ludo board using pygame

**Technologies & Libraries Used**
**Python 3.x**

pygame – for rendering graphics and handling events

random – for simulating dice rolls

math – for coordinate calculations (optional)

time – for animations or delays (optional

 Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ludo-python.git
cd ludo-python
Install dependencies:

pip install pygame
Run the game:

python main.py

**How It Works**
Players take turns rolling the dice

A piece moves based on dice value

Implemented basic win condition (optional)

Add logic for safe spots, kills, and re-entry (can be extended)

To-Do / Improvements
Add complete rule logic (killing, safe zones)

Improve UI/UX

Add AI opponent (single-player mode)

Save/load game state
